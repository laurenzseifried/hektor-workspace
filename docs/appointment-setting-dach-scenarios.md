# Appointment Setting Business — DACH Market (Final Scenarios)

**Decision:** AI-gestütztes Appointment Setting für deutsche SaaS & B2B Scale-ups  
**Market:** DACH (Deutschland, Österreich, Schweiz) + EU  
**Created:** 2026-02-11 14:25 GMT+1  
**Based on:** Scout's DACH Market Research + Competitive Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

**Opportunity:** Appointment Setting ist in DACH **unterversorgt** (keine großen dedizierten Player) und **lukrativer** als Lead Gen (60-80% Margin vs 40-50%).

**Positioning:** *"AI-gestütztes Appointment Setting für deutsche Startups & Scale-ups — qualifizierte Meetings statt nur Kontakte."*

**Target ICP:** SaaS/B2B Scale-ups (Series A+), 10-200 Mitarbeiter, €1M-€20M ARR, DACH-Region

**Pricing:** €2.500-€5.000/Monat Retainer (10-20 Meetings/Monat garantiert)

**Revenue Target (Year 1):** €30K-€60K MRR (6-12 Clients)

---

## Market Context (Scout's Research Summary)

### Why Appointment Setting > Lead Gen?

| Metric | Lead Gen | Appointment Setting |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Output** | Kontaktinfos | Qualifizierte Meetings |
| **Value** | Rohstoff | Direkter Sales Impact |
| **Pricing (DACH)** | €50-€400/Lead | €200-€400/Meeting |
| **Margin** | 40-50% | 60-80% |
| **Competition (DACH)** | High (7+ große Player) | **Low (keine dedizierten Agencies)** |
| **Revenue Model** | Pay-per-Lead (volatil) | Retainer (recurring) |

### DACH Market Gaps

1. ✅ **Kein dedizierter DACH Appointment Setting Player** — US-Agencies (Belkins, CIENCE) dominieren, aber nicht DACH-fokussiert
2. ✅ **Deutsche Unternehmen zahlen Prämien** für deutschsprachige Services (Vertrauensaufbau, Kulturfit)
3. ✅ **Höherpreisig + Recurring** — €2.500-€5.000/Monat Retainer Standard (vs. €500-€2.000 Lead Gen)
4. ✅ **300-600 potenzielle Kunden in DACH** (SaaS/B2B Scale-ups mit AS-Budget)

---

## Scenario 1: **Premium Appointment Setting für SaaS Scale-ups** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

### Target ICP

- **ARR:** €1M-€20M
- **Geography:** DACH (Deutschland, Österreich, Schweiz) + EU
- **Selling to:** SMBs oder Mid-Market (NOT Enterprise initially)
- **Pain Point:** Need consistent pipeline, but lean sales team (1-5 BDRs max)

**Examples:**
- **Project Management:** Asana/Monday.com competitors
- **Sales Automation:** HubSpot/Salesforce alternatives (DACH-focused)
- **HR Tech:** Personio-like companies, scaling hiring

---

### Service Package: "Done-For-You Appointment Setting"

**What You Deliver:**

**1. Monthly Guaranteed Meetings (10-20/Month)**
- Qualified appointments with decision-makers
- Pre-qualified via BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)
- Booked directly into client's calendar
- No-shows replaced (guarantee)

**2. Full Outreach Execution**
- Scout researches leads (Apollo, LinkedIn, Brave Search)
- Hektor qualifies + drafts personalized outreach
- We send emails via client's domain (or ours, client chooses)
- Follow-ups (3-5 rounds until reply or disqualify)

**3. Meeting Prep Materials**
- Company background (revenue, tech stack, pain points)
- Contact research (LinkedIn, recent news, posts)
- Suggested talk track (what to pitch, objection handling)
- Post-meeting feedback loop (did they show? quality?)

**4. Weekly Reporting**
- Dashboard access (leads contacted, response rate, meetings booked)
- Quality metrics (show rate, SQL conversion)
- Insights: What messaging works, what doesn't

**What You DON'T Do (Yet):**
- Sales calls themselves (client's sales team does that)
- Closing deals (client does that)
- CRM management (client updates their own CRM)

---

### Pricing Model

**Option A: Monthly Retainer (Flat Fee)**
- **€2.500/Monat** — 10-15 Meetings guaranteed
- **€4.000/Monat** — 16-25 Meetings guaranteed
- **€6.000/Monat** — 26-40 Meetings guaranteed (enterprise tier)

**No-show/Unqualified Replacement:** If a meeting no-shows or is unqualified, we replace it (same month or next).

**Minimum Commitment:** 3 Monate (typical SaaS contract)

---

**Option B: Hybrid (Retainer + Performance Bonus)**
- **€2.000/Monat base** (covers 8 Meetings minimum)
- **+€200 per additional Meeting** booked above 8
- Example: 15 Meetings = €2.000 + (7 × €200) = €3.400/Monat

**Why this works:**
- Lower barrier to entry (€2K vs €2.5K)
- Upside for both parties (volume = more revenue)
- Aligns incentives (we book more, we earn more)

---

**Option C: Pay-per-Appointment (No Retainer)**
- **€300 per qualified Meeting** (shows up, decision-maker)
- No monthly minimum (project-based or test clients)
- Higher per-meeting cost, but no commitment

**Use Case:** Pilot clients, seasonal campaigns, risk-averse customers

---

**RECOMMENDED PRICING:** **Option B (Hybrid)** — €2.000 base + €200/extra meeting

**Why?**
- Lower entry point = easier to close first clients
- Performance upside = we're incentivized to deliver
- Predictable base = recurring revenue foundation
- Scales naturally (10 meetings = €2.4K, 20 meetings = €4.4K)

---

### Revenue Projections (Month 1-12)

**Assumptions:**
- Start with 1 client (Month 1)
- Add 1-2 clients/month (Month 2-6)
- Stabilize at 8-10 clients (Month 7-12)

#### Hektor + Scout Autonomous (95%)

**Scout's Role:**
1. **Lead Research** (Apollo, LinkedIn, Brave Search)
   - Query: "VP Sales at Series A SaaS, DACH, 10-100 employees"
   - Parse results: Name, email, LinkedIn, company data
   - Dedup against existing database
   - Post raw findings to #lead-gen

**Hektor's Role:**
1. **Lead Qualification**
   - Verify email + LinkedIn profile
   - Research company (revenue, tech stack, pain points)
   - Score lead (1-10): Budget fit, authority, need, timing
   - Filter: Keep only 7+/10 for outreach

2. **Outreach Execution**
   - Draft personalized emails (3 variations tested)
   - Schedule sending (staggered, not all at once)
   - Follow-ups (Days 3, 7, 14, 21)
   - Track responses in dashboard

3. **Meeting Booking**
   - Reply to interested leads ("Yes, let's talk")
   - Confirm availability via Calendly/Cal.com

4. **Reporting**
   - Weekly summary to client (via email or Slack)
   - Dashboard update (live metrics)
   - Quality feedback loop (did meeting happen? was it qualified?)

---

#### Your Role (5%)

**1. Client Onboarding (30min/client, one-time)**
- Discovery call: What's their ICP? What messaging works?
- Setup: Integrate calendar, email domain (if needed)
- Define: What's a "qualified" meeting for them?

**2. Sales Calls (1-2 hours/week)**
- Prospect new clients (cold outreach, referrals, inbound)
- Close deals (1-2 discovery calls per prospect)
- Target: 2-4 new clients/month in growth phase

**3. Quality Reviews (30min/week)**
- Spot-check: Are meetings actually qualified?
- Feedback to Hektor: Adjust ICP/messaging if needed
- Client check-ins: Monthly 15min call (how's it going?)

**4. Escalations (as needed)**
- Client complaints (rare, but handle personally)
- Strategic decisions (pricing changes, new services)

**Total Time Investment:** 3-5 hours/week (mostly sales calls for new clients)

---

---

### Client Acquisition (How to Get First 5 Clients)

**Method 1: Cold Outreach (Hektor + Scout do this FOR YOU)**

**Target:** SaaS Founders/Sales Heads on LinkedIn
- **Message Template:**
  > "Hi [Name], saw [Company] is scaling fast. We help DACH SaaS companies like yours book 10-15 qualified meetings/month with AI agents — no SDR team needed. Want a free 3-meeting pilot?"

- **Volume:** 100 cold DMs/week
- **Conversion:** 2-5% response rate → 2-5 replies/week → 1 client/month

---

**Method 2: Reddit + Startup Communities**

**Channels:**
- r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur (English)
- German Startup Slack/Discord groups
- SaaStr (SaaS community)

**Post:**
> "I built an AI-powered appointment setting system for DACH SaaS companies. Booked 15 meetings/month for my first 3 clients. AMA."

**Offer:** Free 3-meeting pilot for first 5 responders (no strings attached)

**Conversion:** 10-20 DMs → 2-3 serious prospects → 1 client

---

**Method 3: Content Marketing (Long-term)**

**Blog/LinkedIn Posts:**
- "How we book 15 qualified SaaS meetings/month with AI"
- "Why German SaaS companies should stop doing outbound in-house"
- "Case Study: €10K MRR from 50 AI-booked meetings"

**SEO Keywords:**
- "Appointment Setting DACH"
- "SaaS Lead Generation Deutschland"
- "B2B Terminvereinbarung AI"

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to traction, but compounds

---

**Method 4: Referrals (After First Wins)**

**Incentive:** €500 Referral Bonus
- After first successful month with Client A
- Ask: "Know another SaaS founder who needs meetings? We'll give you €500 for every paying client you refer."

**Conversion:** 1 happy client → 1-2 referrals over 6 months

---

## Final Recommendation: **Scenario 1 (Premium SaaS Appointment Setting)**

### Why?

1. ✅ **Highest MRR Potential** — €30K-€33K in Year 1 (vs €15K-€24K in Scenario 2, €20K-€30K in Scenario 3)
2. ✅ **Lowest Time Investment** — 3-5 hrs/week (vs 6-10 hrs in Scenario 3)
3. ✅ **DACH Market Gap** — Scout confirmed: no large dedicated AS players in DACH
4. ✅ **95% Autonomous** — Hektor + Scout can run almost entirely without you
5. ✅ **Scalable** — Once proven with 2-3 clients, easy to replicate to 10-12
6. ✅ **Low Churn** — SaaS companies need consistent pipeline, stick with providers that work
7. ✅ **Recurring Revenue** — Retainer-based (vs project-based or pay-per-lead volatility)

### After 6-12 Months:

**If Scenario 1 is working:**
- Scale to 15-20 SaaS clients (€45K-€60K MRR)
- Hire: Sales closer (you focus on strategy)
- Expand: EU markets (UK, Nordics, France)

**Or Add Scenario 3 (Niche Vertical):**
- Position as premium tier (€5K/Mo vs €2.8K)
- Target 2-3 healthcare/fintech clients
- Diversify revenue (less dependent on SaaS market)

**Or Test Scenario 2 (Agencies) as Side Revenue:**
- White-label offering (low touch, high volume)
- 2-3 agency clients = +€6K-€9K MRR
