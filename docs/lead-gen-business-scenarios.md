---

**Who:**
- B2B SaaS startups (Series A-C)
- 10-100 employees
- ARR: $500K-$10M

- **+$100 per lead above 20**
- Example: 50 leads = $2,500 + (30 × $100) = $5,500/mo

**Option C: Appointment-Based (CPA)**

**Your Role:**

**Method 2: Reddit + Communities**
- Post in r/SaaS, r/startups: "I built an AI lead gen system for SaaS. AMA"
- Offer: Free 10-lead sample for first 3 clients
- Conversion: 5-10 DMs → 1-2 clients

**Method 3: Referrals**

## Recommendation: **Start with Scenario 1 (SaaS Lead Gen)**

**Why?**
1. ✅ **Best ROI:** $25K-$50K MRR in Year 1 with minimal time investment
2. ✅ **Proven Market:** SaaS companies are the #1 buyers of lead gen
3. ✅ **High Automation:** Hektor + Scout can run 80% autonomously
4. ✅ **Scalable:** Once proven with 1-2 clients, easy to replicate
5. ✅ **Low Churn:** SaaS companies need consistent pipeline, stick with providers that work

**After 6 Months:**
- If Scenario 1 is working → scale to 10+ SaaS clients
- Or → Test Scenario 3 (Niche) for premium positioning
- Or → Add Scenario 2 (Agencies) as side revenue stream
