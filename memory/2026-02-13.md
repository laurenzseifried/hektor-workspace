# 2026-02-13 Session Log

## Workspace Cleanup
- Deleted `agents/main` (redundant template)
- Merged `workspace-main` into main workspace (Infrastructure, Cron, Dashboard docs) → deleted
- Deleted `workspace-laurenz` (unused)
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (not needed post-setup)
- Confirmed: `/project/` folder = agent metadata (identity, context, tasks, log)

## Agent Architecture Discussion
- Hunter agent created + tested + deleted (decision: use Sub-Agents via Hektor instead)
- Scout heartbeat disabled (on hold, responds only when addressed)
- Key learning: Sub-agents only get AGENTS.md + TOOLS.md from workspace (not SOUL/IDENTITY/USER/HEARTBEAT/MEMORY)
- Cross-agent spawning needs `allowAgents` in agent config
- Sub-agent auth: needs auth-profiles.json in agent dir, otherwise falls back to Ollama

## Matt Ganzak Training
- Reviewed Multi-Agent Routing doc + Cold Outreach Playbook (9 phases)
- Project/Task folder structure = organization + prompts as .md files
- Lobster = execution/orchestration (complementary, not competing)
- Matthews "12 agents" = temporary sessions_spawn, not permanent agents
- Route command in AGENTS.md tells agent about folder structure

## Dashboard
- Dashboard active (pm2, localhost:3000)
- Project "KontaktManufaktur" created
- Task KONTAKTMANUFAKTUR-001 (Launch Timeline, in-progress)
- Docs: launch-timeline.md + google-workspace-setup.md (linked to task)

## Config Changes
- Removed Hunter from agents.list
- Removed Scout heartbeat
- Added `subagents.allowAgents: ["scout"]` to Hektor
- Lobster tool already allowed (`tools.alsoAllow: ["lobster"]`)

## Learnings
- Pre-flight checks: verify system state before claiming tools missing (Lobster was installed but MEMORY said otherwise)
- `/clear` not a Telegram command — only `/new` and `/reset` work
- Google Workspace aliases don't work for cold outreach (shared reputation, no separate SMTP login)
- Warmup needs 2-4 weeks — start immediately, build pipeline in parallel
