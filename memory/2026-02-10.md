## Session: Model Routing Correction (07:42-07:49 GMT+1)

### Correction Received
- **From:** Ciphershell (Laurenz)
- **Topic:** Model Routing — Active Decision Matrix
- **Issue:** I was making up my own routing rules instead of using the official matrix
- **Action Taken:** Found official matrix in ~/hektor-docs/hektor-bootstrap.md (Part 1, "Model Routing — Kategorie-basiert")
- **Resolution:** Updated MEMORY.md with authoritative Decision Matrix, committed to git

### Official Decision Matrix (Now Active)
**Ollama:** Automated checks only (Heartbeats, Status, Log-Parsing, JSON-Validierung)
**Haiku:** Default for structured tasks (Task-Mgmt, Data-Processing, Templates, Memory, simple Code, Research, Dashboard, Routine Telegram)
**Sonnet:** Creativity/Analysis/Judgment (Emails, Templates, Strategic Analysis, Reports, Code Review, Brainstorming)
**Opus:** 3 Explicit Triggers (Irreversible Business Decisions, Laurenz `/opus`, Weekly Quality Audit)

**Decision Tree for Unknown Tasks:**
1. Needs Creativity OR Judgment? → Sonnet
2. Needs Analysis OR Conclusions? → Sonnet
3. Everything else → Haiku

### Key Learning
- **[LRN-20260210-001]** Don't improvise operational rules. Use official schemas from hektor-docs/. Laurenz already documented these during bootstrap — I should reference them, not recreate them.
- **[LRN-20260210-002]** Active routing means checking the matrix BEFORE responding, not just after. Conscious model selection per task-type.
- This is critical for autonomous operations later — consistency matters.

### Git Commit
```
feat: Add Active Decision Matrix for model routing per hektor-bootstrap.md
```

## Session 2: Config Change Rule Extension (08:07-08:09 GMT+1)

### Instruction Received
- **From:** Ciphershell (Laurenz)
- **Rule:** Extend Sonnet routing to include ALL config changes (Agent Settings, Skills, Env-Vars, openclaw.json)
- **Scope:** Apply to both Hektor AND Scout

### Actions Completed
1. Updated MEMORY.md with extended Sonnet rule
2. Updated hektor-docs/hektor-bootstrap.md (authoritative source) with new rule
3. Created Scout's MEMORY.md with identical routing matrix
4. Updated Scout's AGENTS.md with routing section

### Enforcement Points
- Hektor MEMORY.md: Updated Sonnet section
- Scout AGENTS.md: New "Model Routing" section (short form)
- Scout MEMORY.md: Full matrix matching Hektor
- hektor-docs/hektor-bootstrap.md: Authoritative documentation updated

## Session 3: Groq Whisper Integration Issue (08:15-08:19 GMT+1)

### Blocker Discovered
- **Audio Transcription:** Was using local Whisper (openai-whisper CLI skill) but Laurenz uses Groq API Whisper instead
- **Missing Config:** GROQ_API_KEY not set in environment
- **Action Needed:** Configure Groq API key, verify Groq Whisper endpoint

### Wrong Skill Installation
- `coding-agentoj9u` in skills/ should be `coding-agent` (OpenClaw standard)
- Naming issue with "oj9u" suffix — needs investigation/cleanup

### Operational Notes
- Spawned Sonnet sub-agent to implement Groq integration (correct routing for config changes)
- Config changes MUST use Sonnet per new rule

## Blockers for Next Session
1. **GROQ_API_KEY** environment variable missing
2. **coding-agent** naming issue to resolve
3. Sonnet sub-agent implementation (check status)

## Next Session
- Resolve Groq API key setup
- Verify audio transcription works with Groq
- Clean up coding-agent skill naming
- Monitor Active Decision Matrix application

**Status:** Operational blockers identified. Awaiting config resolution.
