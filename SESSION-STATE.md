# SESSION-STATE.md

**Active working memory for current session/task.** This is the "RAM" — write critical details here BEFORE responding to user. Survives memory compaction.

**Rule:** If important enough to remember, write it NOW. Not later.

## Current Bootstrap Status
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Phase**: Post-Bootstrap Implementation
**Focus**: Integrating self-improving-agent and proactive-agent protocols

### Key Decisions (WAL Protocol)
- Use `self-improving-agent` for continuous learning capture
- Use `proactive-agent` protocols: WAL, Working Buffer, Compaction Recovery
- Skill Scanner Protocol: Always scan before install (`skill-scanner scan <path>`)
- Cisco Scanner location: `/opt/homebrew/bin/skill-scanner`

### Active Task
Implementing self-improvement and proactive-agent operating systems into Hektor workspace.

### Working Items
- [ ] Set up `.learnings/` directory with logging protocols
- [ ] Create SESSION-STATE.md (this file) for WAL Protocol tracking
- [ ] Implement Working Buffer Protocol for danger-zone context survival
- [ ] Create Compaction Recovery checklist
- [ ] Add reverse-prompting triggers to AGENTS.md
- [ ] Integrate Relentless Resourcefulness into workflow
- [ ] Set up VFM scoring for self-modifications

## Recent Corrections (WAL)
- **Correction 1**: cisco-ai-skill-scanner already installed via Homebrew (not npm)
- **Correction 2**: clawhub install command doesn't support destination path parameter

## Important Preferences
- Language: German (Laurenz prefers Deutsch)
- Tone: Direct, no corporate speak
- Decision-making: Assume autonomy internally, ask externally for emails/posts/money
- Speed: Action-oriented, minimize unnecessary back-and-forth
